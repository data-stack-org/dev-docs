# Feature flow

Stages of working with features:

1. Definition
* Research
* Discussion
* Planning
* Implementation

**Note:** All stages except discussion with a team can be made(or even skipped) by a single developer.

Every feature must:

* Have a description on a separate page
* Have Use-Case diagram to visualise the description and goal of the feature

Before implementing a feature:

* Update feature tree diagram.
* Update UI flow diagram.
